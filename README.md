# Ecosystem
final project:

This project incorperates a snake predator that orbits around a mover to give a slithering-like effect. There are boids that incorperate flocking using cohesion, seperation, and alignment. These elements provide smooth transitions when escaping the hunter or joining another flock. The snake will hunt down these boids and eat them which leads into the particle sysetem which spits out another boid right when the other is eaten. This project is aesthetically pleasing and can run without error for days.
